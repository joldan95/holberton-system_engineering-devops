# Load balancer project: _0x0F-load\_balancer_

This project is made to understand the importance and applicability of load balancers in web servers to distribute the load between many servers.

## Objectives

- What is a load balancer
- How to customize HTTP headers
- How to install load balancers with HAproxy


## Tasks

#### [0. Double the number of webservers](0-custom_http_response-header)

The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works. More in the coming tasks.
